### About

I'm a guy passionate for the technology, honest and a self-taught Front-End Developer. I consider myself as a person with initiative, who loves to take on new responsibilities, learning new things and face great challanges. With over 10 years of experience in the web industry. I specialize in the visual appearance of the websites or rather in their design, taking into account the technical requirements, functionality and user considerations. As a Front-End developer, I have a great understanding of what it means, to provide high availability of Web applications and user experience.
